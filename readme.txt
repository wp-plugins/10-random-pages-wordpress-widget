By using this plug-in in combination with Google analytics you may find you get significant traffic for a topic your blog doesn't cover due to the added keywords from this widget.  

**For example**

* Your entry on *"Making a Carrot Cake"* may contain a random link to *"Making Tomato Soup"* when it is cached by google.  
* Due to this, you start receiving traffic for the search term "Tomato Soup Cake" because of the presence of all those words on your post at the time of caching.  
* **You have just identified a high value keyword** which will give you guaranteed traffic if developed into a full post.
* Since the links are random, the next time google caches the page it may find yet another keyphrase that drives traffic. Develop it into a post as well!
